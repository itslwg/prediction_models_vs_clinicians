abstract = {BACKGROUND In order to assist health service planning, understanding factors that influence higher trauma treatment costs is essential. The majority of trauma costing research reports the cost of trauma from the perspective of the receiving hospital. There has been no comprehensive synthesis and little assessment of the drivers of cost variation, such as country, trauma, subgroups and methods. The aim of this review is to provide a synthesis of research reporting the trauma treatment costs and factors associated with higher treatment costs in high income countries. METHODS A systematic search for articles relating to the cost of acute trauma care was performed and included studies reporting injury severity scores (ISS), per patient cost/charge estimates; and costing methods. Cost and charge values were indexed to 2011 cost equivalents and converted to US dollars using purchasing power parities. RESULTS A total of twenty-seven studies were reviewed. Eighty-one percent of these studies were conducted in high income countries including USA, Australia, Europe and UK. Studies either reported a cost (74.1{\%}) or charge estimate (25.9{\%}) for the acute treatment of trauma. Across studies, the median per patient cost of acute trauma treatment was {\$}22,448 (IQR: {\$}11,819-{\$}33,701). However, there was variability in costing methods used with 18{\%} of studies providing comprehensive cost methods. Sixty-three percent of studies reported cost or charge items incorporated in their cost analysis and 52{\%} reported items excluded in their analysis. In all publications reviewed, predictors of cost included Injury Severity Score (ISS), surgical intervention, hospital and intensive care, length of stay, polytrauma and age. CONCLUSION The acute treatment cost of trauma is higher than other disease groups. Research has been largely conducted in high income countries and variability exists in reporting costing methods as well as the actual costs. Patient populations studied and the cost methods employed are the primary drivers for the treatment costs. Targeted research into the costs of trauma care is required to facilitate informed health service planning.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a prognostic model that estimates survival over a 180-day period for seriously ill hospitalized adults (phase I of SUPPORT [Study to Understand Prognoses and Preferences for Outcomes and Risks of Treatments]) and to compare this model's predictions with those of an existing prognostic system and with physicians' independent estimates (SUPPORT phase II). DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: 5 tertiary care academic centers in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: 4301 hospitalized adults were selected for phase I according to diagnosis and severity of illness; 4028 patients were evaluated from phase II. MEASUREMENTS: A survival model was developed using the following predictor variables: diagnosis, age, number of days in the hospital before study entry, presence of cancer, neurologic function, and 11 physiologic measures recorded on day 3 after study entry. Physicians were interviewed on day 3. Patients were followed for survival for 180 days after study entry. RESULTS: The area under the receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) curve for prediction of surviving 180 days was 0.79 in phase I, 0.78 in the phase II independent validation, and 0.78 when the acute physiology score from the APACHE (Acute Physiology, Age, Chronic Health Evaluation) III prognostic scoring system was substituted for the SUPPORT physiology score. For phase II patients, the SUPPORT model had equal discrimination and slightly improved calibration compared with physician's estimates. Combining the SUPPORT model with physician's estimates improved both predictive accuracy (ROC curve area = 0.82) and the ability to identify patients with high probabilities of survival or death. CONCLUSIONS: A limited amount of readily available clinical information can provide a foundation for long-term survival estimates that are as accurate as physicians' estimates. The best survival estimates combine an objective prognosis with a physician's clinical estimate.},

abstract = {Developing a hydrological forecasting model based on past records is crucial to effective hydropower reservoir management and scheduling. Traditionally, time series analysis and modeling is used for building mathematical models to generate hydrologic records in hydrology and water resources. Artificial intelligence (AI), as a branch of computer science, is capable of analyzing long-series and large-scale hydrological data. In recent years, it is one of front issues to apply AI technology to the hydrological forecasting modeling. In this paper, autoregressive moving-average (ARMA) models, artificial neural networks (ANNs) approaches, adaptive neural-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) techniques, genetic programming (GP) models and support vector machine (SVM) method are examined using the long-term observations of monthly river flow discharges. The four quantitative standard statistical performance evaluation measures, the coefficient of correlation (R), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (E), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), are employed to evaluate the performances of various models developed. Two case study river sites are also provided to illustrate their respective performances. The results indicate that the best performance can be obtained by ANFIS, GP and SVM, in terms of different evaluation criteria during the training and validation phases. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Much time and effort are spent on designing primary research studies. Similar care must be given to planning systematic reviews. The review should be based on an important, well-focused question that is relevant to patient care. By formulating the question properly, the criteria that primary studies must meet to be included in the review become clear. These criteria, which comprise the types of persons involved, exposure, control group, outcomes, and study designs of interest, can then be refined so that they are clinically relevant, sensible, and workable. Inclusion criteria that are too narrow will limit the amount of data in the review, thereby increasing the risk for chance results and making the review less useful for the reader. Reviews should include studies whose designs offer the least biased answer to the question being asked. To maximize available data and reduce the risk for bias, as many relevant studies as possible need to be identified, regardless of publication status or language. Multiple overlapping search strategies should therefore be used and must be carefully planned. Strategies include searching the many electronic databases available (after careful consideration of which terms to enter), manually searching journals and conference proceedings, searching bibliographies of articles, searching existing registers of studies, and contacting companies or researchers. The time taken to formulate the question adequately and develop appropriate searches will increase the chance of producing a high-quality, meaningful review.},

abstract = {{Why has median income stopped rising in the US?Why is the share of population that is working falling so rapidly?Why are our economy and society are becoming more unequal?{\}}A popular explanation right now is that the root cause underlying these symptoms is technological stagnation-- a slowdown in the kinds of ideas and inventions that bring progress and prosperity. In $\backslash$emph{\{}Race Against the Machine{\}}, MIT's Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee present a very different explanation. Drawing on research by their team at the Center for Digital Business, they show that there's been no stagnation in technology -- in fact, the digital revolution is accelerating. Recent advances are the stuff of science fiction: computers now drive cars in traffic, translate between human languages effectively, and beat the best human Jeopardy! players. As these examples show, digital technologies are rapidly encroaching on skills that used to belong to humans alone. This phenomenon is both broad and deep, and has profound economic implications. Many of these implications are positive; digital innovation increases productivity, reduces prices (sometimes to zero), and grows the overall economic pie. But digital innovation has also changed how the economic pie is distributed, and here the news is not good for the median worker. As technology races ahead, it can leave many people behind. Workers whose skills have been mastered by computers have less to offer the job market, and see their wages and prospects shrink. Entrepreneurial business models, new organizational structures and different institutions are needed to ensure that the average worker is not left behind by cutting-edge machines. In $\backslash$emph{\{}Race Against the Machine{\}} Brynjolfsson and McAfee bring together a range of statistics, examples, and arguments to show that technological progress is accelerating, and that this trend has deep consequences for skills, wages, and jobs. The book makes the case that employment prospects are grim for many today not because there's been technology has stagnated, but instead because we humans and our organizations aren't keeping up.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence research has foundered on the issue of representation. When intelligence is approached in an incremental manner, with strict reliance on interfacing to the real world through perception and action, reliance on representation disappears. In this paper we outline our approach to incrementally building complete intelligent Creatures. The fundamental decomposition of the intelligent system is not into independent information processing units which must interface with each other via representations. Instead, the intelligent system is decomposed into independent and parallel activity producers which all interface directly to the world through perception and action, rather than interface to each other particularly much. The notions of central and peripheral systems evaporate—everything is both central and peripheral. Based on these principles we have built a very successful series of mobile robots which operate without supervision as Creatures in standard office environments.},

abstract = {Injury has become a major cause of death and disability worldwide. Organized approaches to its prevention and treatment are needed. These guidelines seek to set achievable standards for trauma treatment services which could realistically be made available to almost every injured person in the world. They then seek to define the resources that would be necessary to assure such care. The authors of the guidelines have developed a series of resource tables for essential trauma care that detail the human and physical resources that should be in place to assure optimal care of injured patients at the range of health facilities throughout the world, from rural health posts, to small hospitals, to hospitals staffed by specialists, to tertiary care centers. They also take into account the varying resource availability across the spectrum of low- and middle-income countries. Finally, a series of recommendations is made on methods to promote such standards including training, performance improvement, trauma team organization and hospital inspection. The resource tables and associated recommendations are intended to provide a template to assist individual countries in organizing and enhancing their own trauma treatment systems. It is anticipated that the template will be adapted to suit local circumstances.},

abstract = {Background Trauma is the leading cause of death in individuals younger than 40 years. There are many different models for predicting patient outcome following trauma. To our knowledge, no comprehensive review has been performed on prognostic models for the general trauma population. Therefore, this review aimed to describe (1) existing mortality prediction models for the general trauma population, (2) the methodological quality and (3) which variables are most relevant for the model prediction of mortality in the general trauma population. Methods An online search was conducted in June 2015 using Embase, Medline, Web of Science, Cinahl, Cochrane, Google Scholar and PubMed. Relevant English peer-reviewed articles that developed, validated or updated mortality prediction models in a general trauma population were included. Results A total of 90 articles were included. The cohort sizes ranged from 100 to 1,115,389 patients, with overall mortality rates that ranged from 0.6{\%} to 35{\%}. The Trauma and Injury Severity Score (TRISS) was the most commonly used model. A total of 258 models were described in the articles, of which only 103 models (40{\%}) were externally validated. Cases with missing values were often excluded and discrimination of the different prediction models ranged widely (AUROC between 0.59 and 0.98). The predictors were often included as dichotomized or categorical variables, while continuous variables showed better performance. Conclusion Researchers are still searching for a better mortality prediction model in the general trauma population. Models should 1) be developed and/or validated using an adequate sample size with sufficient events per predictor variable, 2) use multiple imputation models to address missing values, 3) use the continuous variant of the predictor if available and 4) incorporate all different types of readily available predictors (i.e., physiological variables, anatomical variables, injury cause/mechanism, and demographic variables). Furthermore, while mortality rates are decreasing, it is important to develop models that predict physical, cognitive status, or quality of life to measure quality of care.},

Areas of particular importance include biotech- nology, nanotechnology, materials technology, and information technology. A sample of 29 countries across the spectrum of scientific advancement (low to high) was assessed with respect to the countries' ability to acquire and implement 16 key technology applications (e.g., cheap solar energy, rural wireless communications, genetically modified crops). The study's major conclusions include the following: • • • Scientifically advanced countries, such as the United States, Germany, and Japan, will be able to implement all key technologies assessed. Countries that are not scientifically advanced will have to develop significant capacity and motivation before barriers to technology implementation can be overcome. Public policy issues in certain areas will engender public debate and strongly influence technology implementation. Many technology trends and applications have substantial momentum behind them and will be the focus of continued research and development, consideration, market forces, and debate. These technologies will be applied in some guise or other, and the effects could be dra- matic, including significant improvements in human lifespan, reshuffling of wealth, cultural amalgamation or innovation, and reduced privacy.},

abstract = {Null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) is the dominant statistical approach in biology, although it has many, frequently unappreciated, problems. Most importantly, NHST does not provide us with two crucial pieces of information: (1) the magnitude of an effect of interest, and (2) the precision of the estimate of the magnitude of that effect. All biologists should be ultimately interested in biological importance, which may be assessed using the magnitude of an effect, but not its statistical significance. Therefore, we advocate presentation of measures of the magnitude of effects (i.e. effect size statistics) and their confidence intervals (CIs) in all biological journals. Combined use of an effect size and its CIs enables one to assess the relationships within data more effectively than the use of p values, regardless of statistical significance. In addition, routine presentation of effect sizes will encourage researchers to view their results in the context of previous research and facilitate the incorporation of results into future meta-analysis, which has been increasingly used as the standard method of quantitative review in biology. In this article, we extensively discuss two dimensionless (and thus standardised) classes of effect size statistics: d statistics (standardised mean difference) and r statistics (correlation coefficient), because these can be calculated from almost all study designs and also because their calculations are essential for meta-analysis. However, our focus on these standardised effect size statistics does not mean unstandardised effect size statistics (e.g. mean difference and regression coefficient) are less important. We provide potential solutions for four main technical problems researchers may encounter when calculating effect size and CIs: (1) when covariates exist, (2) when bias in estimating effect size is possible, (3) when data have non-normal error structure and/or variances, and (4) when data are non-independent. Although interpretations of effect sizes are often difficult, we provide some pointers to help researchers. This paper serves both as a beginner's instruction manual and a stimulus for changing statistical practice for the better in the biological sciences.},

abstract = {Monitoring levels and trends in premature mortality is crucial to understanding how societies can address prominent sources of early death. The Global Burden of Disease 2016 Study (GBD 2016) provides a comprehensive assessment of cause-specific mortality for 264 causes in 195 locations from 1980 to 2016. This assessment includes evaluation of the expected epidemiological transition with changes in development and where local patterns deviate from these trends. METHODS We estimated cause-specific deaths and years of life lost (YLLs) by age, sex, geography, and year. YLLs were calculated from the sum of each death multiplied by the standard life expectancy at each age. We used the GBD cause of death database composed of: vital registration (VR) data corrected for under-registration and garbage coding; national and subnational verbal autopsy (VA) studies corrected for garbage coding; and other sources including surveys and surveillance systems for specific causes such as maternal mortality. To facilitate assessment of quality, we reported on the fraction of deaths assigned to GBD Level 1 or Level 2 causes that cannot be underlying causes of death (major garbage codes) by location and year. Based on completeness, garbage coding, cause list detail, and time periods covered, we provided an overall data quality rating for each location with scores ranging from 0 stars (worst) to 5 stars (best). We used robust statistical methods including the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm) to generate estimates for each location, year, age, and sex. We assessed observed and expected levels and trends of cause-specific deaths in relation to the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary indicator derived from measures of average income per capita, educational attainment, and total fertility, with locations grouped into quintiles by SDI. Relative to GBD 2015, we expanded the GBD cause hierarchy by 18 causes of death for GBD 2016. FINDINGS The quality of available data varied by location. Data quality in 25 countries rated in the highest category (5 stars), while 48, 30, 21, and 44 countries were rated at each of the succeeding data quality levels. Vital registration or verbal autopsy data were not available in 27 countries, resulting in the assignment of a zero value for data quality. Deaths from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) represented 72{\textperiodcentered}3{\%} (95{\%} uncertainty interval [UI] 71{\textperiodcentered}2–73{\textperiodcentered}2) of deaths in 2016 with 19{\textperiodcentered}3{\%} (18{\textperiodcentered}5–20{\textperiodcentered}4) of deaths in that year occurring from communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) diseases and a further 8{\textperiodcentered}43{\%} (8{\textperiodcentered}00–8{\textperiodcentered}67) from injuries. Although age-standardised rates of death from NCDs decreased globally between 2006 and 2016, total numbers of these deaths increased; both numbers and age-standardised rates of death from CMNN causes decreased in the decade 2006–16—age-standardised rates of deaths from injuries decreased but total numbers varied little. In 2016, the three leading global causes of death in children under-5 were lower respiratory infections, neonatal preterm birth complications, and neonatal encephalopathy due to birth asphyxia and trauma, combined resulting in 1{\textperiodcentered}80 million deaths (95{\%} UI 1{\textperiodcentered}59 million to 1{\textperiodcentered}89 million). Between 1990 and 2016, a profound shift toward deaths at older ages occurred with a 178{\%} (95{\%} UI 176–181) increase in deaths in ages 90–94 years and a 210{\%} (208–212) increase in deaths older than age 95 years. The ten leading causes by rates of age-standardised YLL significantly decreased from 2006 to 2016 (median annualised rate of change was a decrease of 2{\textperiodcentered}89{\%}); the median annualised rate of change for all other causes was lower (a decrease of 1{\textperiodcentered}59{\%}) during the same interval. Globally, the five leading causes of total YLLs in 2016 were cardiovascular diseases; diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections, and other common infectious diseases; neoplasms; neonatal disorders; and HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. At a finer level of disaggregation within cause groupings, the ten leading causes of total YLLs in 2016 were ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, lower respiratory infections, diarrhoeal diseases, road injuries, malaria, neonatal preterm birth complications, HIV/AIDS, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and neonatal encephalopathy due to birth asphyxia and trauma. Ischaemic heart disease was the leading cause of total YLLs in 113 countries for men and 97 countries for women. Comparisons of observed levels of YLLs by countries, relative to the level of YLLs expected on the basis of SDI alone, highlighted distinct regional patterns including the greater than expected level of YLLs from malaria and from HIV/AIDS across sub-Saharan Africa; diabetes mellitus, especially in Oceania; interpersonal violence, notably within Latin America and the Caribbean; and cardiomyopathy and myocarditis, particularly in eastern and central Europe. The level of YLLs from ischaemic heart disease was less than expected in 117 of 195 locations. Other leading causes of YLLs for which YLLs were notably lower than expected included neonatal preterm birth complications in many locations in both south Asia and southeast Asia, and cerebrovascular disease in western Europe. INTERPRETATION The past 37 years have featured declining rates of communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases across all quintiles of SDI, with faster than expected gains for many locations relative to their SDI. A global shift towards deaths at older ages suggests success in reducing many causes of early death. YLLs have increased globally for causes such as diabetes mellitus or some neoplasms, and in some locations for causes such as drug use disorders, and conflict and terrorism. Increasing levels of YLLs might reflect outcomes from conditions that required high levels of care but for which effective treatments remain elusive, potentially increasing costs to health systems.

abstract = {Study objective: The assessment of clinical probability (as low, moderate, or high) with clinical decision rules has become a cornerstone of diagnostic strategy for patients with suspected pulmonary embolism, but little is known about the use of physician gestalt assessment of clinical probability. We evaluate the performance of gestalt assessment for diagnosing pulmonary embolism. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of a prospective observational cohort of consecutive suspected pulmonary embolism patients in emergency departments. Accuracy of gestalt assessment was compared with the Wells score and the revised Geneva score by the area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic curves. Agreement between the 3 methods was determined by ?? test. Results: The study population was 1,038 patients, with a pulmonary embolism prevalence of 31.3{\%}. AUC differed significantly between the 3 methods and was 0.81 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 0.78 to 0.84) for gestalt assessment, 0.71 (95{\%} CI 0.68 to 0.75) for Wells, and 0.66 (95{\%} CI 0.63 to 0.70) for the revised Geneva score. The proportion of patients categorized as having low clinical probability was statistically higher with gestalt than with revised Geneva score (43{\%} versus 26{\%}; 95{\%} CI for the difference of 17{\%}=13{\%} to 21{\%}). Proportion of patients categorized as having high clinical probability was higher with gestalt than with Wells (24{\%} versus 7{\%}; 95{\%} CI for the difference of 17{\%}=14{\%} to 20{\%}) or revised Geneva score (24{\%} versus 10{\%}; 95{\%} CI for the difference of 15{\%}=13{\%} to 21{\%}). Pulmonary embolism prevalence was significantly lower with gestalt versus clinical decision rules in low clinical probability (7.6{\%} for gestalt versus 13.0{\%} for revised Geneva score and 12.6{\%} for Wells score) and non-high clinical probability groups (18.3{\%} for gestalt versus 29.3{\%} for Wells and 27.4{\%} for revised Geneva score) and was significantly higher with gestalt versus Wells score in high clinical probability groups (72.1{\%} versus 58.1{\%}). Agreement between the 3 methods was poor, with all ?? values below 0.3. Conclusion: In our retrospective study, gestalt assessment seems to perform better than clinical decision rules because of better selection of patients with low and high clinical probability. ?? 2013 American College of Emergency Physicians.},

abstract = {Context Prediction models are developed to aid health care providers in estimating the probability or risk that a specific disease or condition is present (diagnostic models) or that a specific event will occur in the future (prognostic models), to inform their decision making. However, the overwhelming evidence shows that the quality of reporting of prediction model studies is poor. Only with full and clear reporting of information on all aspects of a prediction model can risk of bias and potential usefulness of prediction models be adequately assessed. Objective The Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) Initiative developed a set of recommendations for the reporting of studies developing, validating, or updating a prediction model, whether for diagnostic or prognostic purposes. Evidence acquisition This article describes how the TRIPOD Statement was developed. An extensive list of items based on a review of the literature was created, which was reduced after a Web-based survey and revised during a 3-day meeting in June 2011 with methodologists, health care professionals, and journal editors. The list was refined during several meetings of the steering group and in e-mail discussions with the wider group of TRIPOD contributors. Evidence synthesis The resulting TRIPOD Statement is a checklist of 22 items, deemed essential for transparent reporting of a prediction model study. The TRIPOD Statement aims to improve the transparency of the reporting of a prediction model study regardless of the study methods used. The TRIPOD Statement is best used in conjunction with the TRIPOD explanation and elaboration document. Conclusions To aid the editorial process and readers of prediction model studies, it is recommended that authors include a completed checklist in their submission (also available at www.tripod-statement.org). Patient summary The Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) Initiative developed a set of recommendations for the reporting of studies developing, validating, or updating a prediction model, whether for diagnostic or prognostic purposes.},

abstract = {Identification of key factors associated with the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and quantification of this risk using multivariable prediction algorithms are among the major advances made in preventive cardiology and cardiovascular epidemiology in the 20th century. The ongoing discovery of new risk markers by scientists presents opportunities and challenges for statisticians and clinicians to evaluate these biomarkers and to develop new risk formulations that incorporate them. One of the key questions is how best to assess and quantify the improvement in risk prediction offered by these new models. Demonstration of a statistically significant association of a new biomarker with cardiovascular risk is not enough. Some researchers have advanced that the improvement in the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) should be the main criterion, whereas others argue that better measures of performance of prediction models are needed. In this paper, we address this question by introducing two new measures, one based on integrated sensitivity and specificity and the other on reclassification tables. These new measures offer incremental information over the AUC. We discuss the properties of these new measures and contrast them with the AUC. We also develop simple asymptotic tests of significance. We illustrate the use of these measures with an example from the Framingham Heart Study. We propose that scientists consider these types of measures in addition to the AUC when assessing the performance of newer biomarkers.},

abstract = {Aim: Physiological track and trigger scores have an established role in enhancing the detection of critical illness in hospitalized patients. Their potential to identify individuals at risk of clinical deterioration in the pre-hospital environment is unknown. This study compared the predictive accuracy of the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) with current clinical practice. Methods: A retrospective observational cohort study of consecutive adult (???16 yrs) emergency department attendances to a single centre over a two-month period. The outcome of interest was the occurrence or not of an adverse event within 24. h of admission. Hospital pre-alerting was used as a measure of current critical illness detection and its accuracy compared with MEWS scores calculated from pre-hospital observations. Results: 3504 patients were included in the study. 76 (2.5{\%}) suffered an adverse event within 24. h of admission. Paramedics pre-alerted the hospital in 224 cases (7.3{\%}). Clinical judgement demonstrated a sensitivity of 61.8{\%} (95{\%} CI 51.0-72.8{\%}) with a specificity of 94.1{\%} (95{\%} CI 93.2-94.9{\%}). MEWS was a good predictor of adverse outcomes and hence critical illness detection (AUC 0.799, 95{\%} CI 0.738-0.856). Combination systems of MEWS and clinical judgement may be effective MEWS ???4. +. clinical judgement: sensitivity 72.4{\%} (95{\%} CI 62.5-82.7{\%}), specificity 84.8{\%} (95{\%} CI 83.52-86.1{\%}). Conclusions: Clinical judgement alone has a low sensitivity for critical illness in the pre-hospital environment. The addition of MEWS improves detection at the expense of reduced specificity. The optimal scoring system to be employed in this setting is yet to be elucidated. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Toward the establishment of an injury surveillance system in Uganda, the first step was to initiate hospital-based trauma registries that generate relevant and timely data on the causes, severity, morbidity, mortality, and outcomes of injuries at Mulago and Kawolo hospitals. This would help establish injury patterns and priorities in these hospital populations. The registries are based on a minimal data set and a new injury severity instrument, the Kampala Trauma Score (KTS). The usefulness of the registry and the qualities of the KTS are presented. METHODS: The Accident and Emergency Department of Mulago, an urban 1,500-bed, tertiary hospital, and the Casualty Unit of Kawolo, a 100-bed district-level hospital. Trained staff in the hospitals used a one-page, 19-item registry form to collect data on demographic, injury incident, and outcome data. The registry describes injuries based on cause, frequency, and severity. The inter-rater reliability and the predictive validity of the KTS were evaluated. Registry subjects include all injured persons that come to the above hospitals. RESULTS: Results are based on the first 5,210 records. Gender distribution was 27.7{\%} female and 71.3{\%} male. The younger than 5 years old category was 7.4{\%}, whereas 3.9{\%} were older than 55 years old. Admitted patients composed 37.3{\%} of cases, and three of four injuries were unintentional. The KTS is highly predictive of need for admission or death (adults, Az = 0.95 +/- 0.01; children, Az = 0.89 +/- 0.01). CONCLUSION: A trauma registry and injury severity measurement are both possible and useful in sub-Saharan Africa. This minimal data set and the KTS are recommended for investigators with similar resource constraints.},

The data used in this study were derived from the Japan Trauma Data Bank (JTDB), which consists of 114 major emergency hospitals in Japan. A total of 35,732 trauma patients in the JTDB from 2004 to 2009 who were 15 years of age or older were eligible for inclusion in the study. Of these patients, 27,154 (76{\%}) with complete sets of important data (patient age, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, systolic blood pressure (SBP), respiratory rate and Injury Severity Score (ISS)) were included in our analysis. We calculated weight for the predictors of the GAP scores on the basis of the records of 13,463 trauma patients in a derivation data set determined by using logistic regression. Scores derived from four existing scoring systems (Revised Trauma Score, Triage Revised Trauma Score, Trauma and Injury Severity Score and MGAP score) were calibrated using logistic regression models that fit in the derivation set. The GAP scoring system was compared to the calibrated scoring systems with data from a total of 13,691 patients in a validation data set using c-statistics and reclassification tables with three defined risk groups based on a previous publication: low risk (mortality {\textless} 5{\%}), intermediate risk, and high risk (mortality {\textgreater} 50{\%}).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Calculated GAP scores involved GCS score (from three to fifteen points), patient age {\textless} 60 years (three points) and SBP ({\textgreater} 120 mmHg, six points; 60 to 120 mmHg, four points). The c-statistics for the GAP scores (0.933 for long-term mortality and 0.965 for short-term mortality) were better than or comparable to the trauma scores calculated using other scales. Compared with existing instruments, our reclassification tables show that the GAP scoring system reclassified all patients except one in the correct direction. In most cases, the observed incidence of death in patients who were reclassified matched what would have been predicted by the GAP scoring system.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The GAP scoring system can predict in-hospital mortality more accurately than the previously developed trauma scoring systems.},

abstract = {The c statistic, or area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, achieved popularity in diagnostic testing, in which the test characteristics of sensitivity and specificity are relevant to discriminating diseased versus nondiseased patients. The c statistic, however, may not be optimal in assessing models that predict future risk or stratify individuals into risk categories. In this setting, calibration is as important to the accurate assessment of risk. For example, a biomarker with an odds ratio of 3 may have little effect on the c statistic, yet an increased level could shift estimated 10-year cardiovascular risk for an individual patient from 8{\%} to 24{\%}, which would lead to different treatment recommendations under current Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines. Accepted risk factors such as lipids, hypertension, and smoking have only marginal impact on the c statistic individually yet lead to more accurate reclassification of large proportions of patients into higher-risk or lower-risk categories. Perfectly calibrated models for complex disease can, in fact, only achieve values for the c statistic well below the theoretical maximum of 1. Use of the c statistic for model selection could thus naively eliminate established risk factors from cardiovascular risk prediction scores. As novel risk factors are discovered, sole reliance on the c statistic to evaluate their utility as risk predictors thus seems ill-advised.},

abstract = {Background Measurement of changes in health across locations is useful to compare and contrast changing epidemiological patterns against health system performance and identify specific needs for resource allocation in research, policy development, and programme decision making. Using the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016, we drew from two widely used summary measures to monitor such changes in population health: disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) and healthy life expectancy (HALE). We used these measures to track trends and benchmark progress compared with expected trends on the basis of the Socio-demographic Index (SDI). Methods We used results from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 for all-cause mortality, cause-specific mortality, and non-fatal disease burden to derive HALE and DALYs by sex for 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2016. We calculated DALYs by summing years of life lost and years of life lived with disability for each location, age group, sex, and year. We estimated HALE using age-specific death rates and years of life lived with disability per capita. We explored how DALYs and HALE differed from expected trends when compared with the SDI: the geometric mean of income per person, educational attainment in the population older than age 15 years, and total fertility rate. Findings The highest globally observed HALE at birth for both women and men was in Singapore, at 75{\textperiodcentered}2 years (95{\%} uncertainty interval 71{\textperiodcentered}9–78{\textperiodcentered}6) for females and 72{\textperiodcentered}0 years (68{\textperiodcentered}8–75{\textperiodcentered}1) for males. The lowest for females was in the Central African Republic (45{\textperiodcentered}6 years [42{\textperiodcentered}0–49{\textperiodcentered}5]) and for males was in Lesotho (41{\textperiodcentered}5 years [39{\textperiodcentered}0–44{\textperiodcentered}0]). From 1990 to 2016, global HALE increased by an average of 6{\textperiodcentered}24 years (5{\textperiodcentered}97–6{\textperiodcentered}48) for both sexes combined. Global HALE increased by 6{\textperiodcentered}04 years (5{\textperiodcentered}74–6{\textperiodcentered}27) for males and 6{\textperiodcentered}49 years (6{\textperiodcentered}08–6{\textperiodcentered}77) for females, whereas HALE at age 65 years increased by 1{\textperiodcentered}78 years (1{\textperiodcentered}61–1{\textperiodcentered}93) for males and 1{\textperiodcentered}96 years (1{\textperiodcentered}69–2{\textperiodcentered}13) for females. Total global DALYs remained largely unchanged from 1990 to 2016 (–2{\textperiodcentered}3{\%} [–5{\textperiodcentered}9 to 0{\textperiodcentered}9]), with decreases in communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) disease DALYs offset by increased DALYs due to non-communicable diseases (NCDs). The exemplars, calculated as the five lowest ratios of observed to expected age-standardised DALY rates in 2016, were Nicaragua, Costa Rica, the Maldives, Peru, and Israel. The leading three causes of DALYs globally were ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and lower respiratory infections, comprising 16{\textperiodcentered}1{\%} of all DALYs. Total DALYs and age-standardised DALY rates due to most CMNN causes decreased from 1990 to 2016. Conversely, the total DALY burden rose for most NCDs; however, age-standardised DALY rates due to NCDs declined globally. Interpretation At a global level, DALYs and HALE continue to show improvements. At the same time, we observe that many populations are facing growing functional health loss. Rising SDI was associated with increases in cumulative years of life lived with disability and decreases in CMNN DALYs offset by increased NCD DALYs. Relative compression of morbidity highlights the importance of continued health interventions, which has changed in most locations in pace with the gross domestic product per person, education, and family planning. The analysis of DALYs and HALE and their relationship to SDI represents a robust framework with which to benchmark location-specific health performance. Country-specific drivers of disease burden, particularly for causes with higher-than-expected DALYs, should inform health policies, health system improvement initiatives, targeted prevention efforts, and development assistance for health, including financial and research investments for all countries, regardless of their level of sociodemographic development. The presence of countries that substantially outperform others suggests the need for increased scrutiny for proven examples of best practices, which can help to extend gains, whereas the presence of underperforming countries suggests the need for devotion of extra attention to health systems that need more robust support.

abstract = {Critical care in low-income countries remains rudimentary. When defined as all aspects of care for patients with sudden, serious, reversible disease, critical care is not disease or age specific and includes triage and emergency medicine, hospital systems, quality of care and Intensive Care Units. This review collates the literature on critical care in low-income countries and explores how the care can be both feasible and effective. Emergency care including triage is often one of the weakest parts of the health system; but if well organized it can be life-saving and cost-effective. Emergency triage and treatment has been developed for paediatric admissions with promising results. Hospital systems do not currently prioritize the critically ill and few hospitals have Intensive Care Units. The quality of care given to inpatients on hospital wards is often poor and could be improved in many ways. There is a lack of training and awareness of the principles of critical care. Basic critical care concentrating on ABC – airway, breathing and circulation – need not be resource intensive. Oxygen is a cheap and effective treatment for pneumonia and other severe disease, but is not always available. Improved critical care could have a significant effect on the burden of disease and effects of ill health. Research into the most cost-effective treatments and methods of caring for critically ill patients is urgently needed},

Restricted cubic splines are a way of testing the hypothesis that the relationship is not linear or summarizing a relationship that is too non-linear to be usefully summarized by a linear relationship. Restricted cubic splines are just a transformation of an independent variable. Thus, they can be used not only in ordinary least squares regression, but also in logistic regression, survival analysis, and so on. The range of values of the independent variable is split up, with " knots " defining the end of one segment and the start of the next. Separate curves are fit to each segment. Overall, the splines are defined so that the resulting fitted curve is smooth and continuous. This presentation describes when splines might be used, how the splines are defined, choice of knots, and interpretation of the regression results.},

abstract = {The Trauma Score (TS) has been revised. The revision includes Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and respiratory rate (RR) and excludes capillary refill and respiratory expansion, which were difficult to assess in the field. Two versions of the revised score have been developed, one for triage (T-RTS) and another for use in outcome evaluations and to control for injury severity (RTS). T-RTS, the sum of coded values of GCS, SBP, and RR, demonstrated increased sensitivity and some loss in specificity when compared with a triage criterion based on TS and GCS values. T-RTS correctly identified more than 97{\%} of nonsurvivors as requiring trauma center care. The T-RTS triage criterion does not require summing of the coded values and is more easily implemented than the TS criterion. RTS is a weighted sum of coded variable values. The RTS demonstrated substantially improved reliability in outcome predictions compared to the TS. The RTS also yielded more accurate outcome predictions for patients with serious head injuries than the TS. PMID: 2657085},

abstract = {Introduction Early recognition and treatment of trauma patients requiring massive transfusion (MT) has been shown to reduce mortality. While many risk factors predicting MT have been demonstrated, there is no universally accepted method or algorithm to identify these patients. We hypothesised that even among experienced trauma surgeons, the clinical gestalt of identifying patients who will require MT is unreliable. Methods Transfusion and mortality outcomes after trauma were observed at 10 U.S. Level-1 trauma centres in patients who survived ???30 min after admission and received ???1 unit of RBC within 6 h of arrival. Subjects who received ???10 units within 24 h of admission were classified as MT patients. Trauma surgeons were asked the clinical gestalt question "Is the patient likely to be massively transfused?" 10 min after the patients arrival. The performance of clinical gestalt to predict MT was assessed using chi-square tests and ROC analysis to compare gestalt to previously described scoring systems. Results Of the 1245 patients enrolled, 966 met inclusion criteria and 221 (23{\%}) patients received MT. 415 (43{\%}) were predicted to have a MT and 551(57{\%}) were predicted to not have MT. Patients predicted to have MT were younger, more often sustained penetrating trauma, had higher ISS scores, higher heart rates, and lower systolic blood pressures (all p {\textless} 0.05). Gestalt sensitivity was 65.6{\%} and specificity was 63.8{\%}. PPV and NPV were 34.9{\%} and 86.2{\%} respectively. Conclusion Data from this large multicenter trial demonstrates that predicting the need for MT continues to be a challenge. Because of the increased mortality associated with delayed therapy, a more reliable algorithm is needed to identify and treat these severely injured patients earlier.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The EuResist expert system is a novel data-driven online system for computing the probability of 8-week success for any given pair of HIV-1 genotype and combination antiretroviral therapy regimen plus optional patient information. The objective of this study was to compare the EuResist system vs. human experts (EVE) for the ability to predict response to treatment.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The EuResist system was compared with 10 HIV-1 drug resistance experts for the ability to predict 8-week response to 25 treatment cases derived from the EuResist database validation data set. All current and past patient data were made available to simulate clinical practice. The experts were asked to provide a qualitative and quantitative estimate of the probability of treatment success.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: There were 15 treatment successes and 10 treatment failures. In the classification task, the number of mislabelled cases was six for EuResist and 6-13 for the human experts [mean±standard deviation (SD) 9.1±1.9]. The accuracy of EuResist was higher than the average for the experts (0.76 vs. 0.64, respectively). The quantitative estimates computed by EuResist were significantly correlated (Pearson r=0.695, P{\textless}0.0001) with the mean quantitative estimates provided by the experts. However, the agreement among experts was only moderate (for the classification task, inter-rater $\kappa$=0.355; for the quantitative estimation, mean±SD coefficient of variation=55.9±22.4{\%}).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: With this limited data set, the EuResist engine performed comparably to or better than human experts. The system warrants further investigation as a treatment-decision support tool in clinical practice.},
